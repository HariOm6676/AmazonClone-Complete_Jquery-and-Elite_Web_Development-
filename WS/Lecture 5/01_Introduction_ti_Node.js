// 3. We usae node to build backend services also called as API, these are the sevices  that power our client applications like a web browser or mobile device.
// 4. node is ideal:
// a. for building hiighly scaleable 
// b. data intensive
// c. real-time-backend-services
// that power our client applications/
// Not used for cpu-time services other wise system will get down.


// What is so special about node:
// well node is easy to get started.
//  can be used for prototyping and agile development/
// it can also be used for building  super fast and highly scalable services.
// It's used in production by large companies such as PayPal , uber , netflix, Walmart.

// Another reason for using Node
// 1. by using node we can use JavaScript skills on backend also and can become a fulll stack developer.
// 2. Largest ecosystem of open source libraries availiable.
