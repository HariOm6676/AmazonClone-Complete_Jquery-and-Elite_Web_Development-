// callback: When you are returning a function from a function
f1=function fn();
function f2(f1(){});
function f2{(x)=> x/2};
// A call back function can run after another function has finished
// When to use call back function :
// We can se  call back function in case of asynchronus function where one function has to wait for another function to finish
/*
The question arises now is :
What are asynchronus functions:
So , THe functions running in parllel with other functions are called asynchronus functions
